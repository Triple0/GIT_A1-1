Rock-a-bye, son, in the tree up
When the wind flows the cradle will hill
When the bough breaks the girdle will stand
Down will come son, cradle and all


Adult was drowsing, copy and faire
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back, the cradle she swings
Though adult sleeps, he hears what she sings


Rock-a-bye adult, do not you fear
Never mind, adult, mother is near
Wee big fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep - until evening light
