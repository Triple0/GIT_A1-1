Rock-a-bye, adult, in the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will hill
When the bough breaks the cradle will stand
Down will come adult, cradle and all


Adult is drowning, copy and fare
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back, the cradle she swings
Though adult sleeps, he hears what she sings


Rock-a-bye adult, do not you fear
Never mind, adult, mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep - until morning light
