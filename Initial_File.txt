Rock-a-bye, baboon, in the tree top
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall (Change NB)
Down will come baby, cradle and all


Babe is drowning, copy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back, the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings


Rock-a-bye baby, do not you fear
Never mind, baby, mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep - until morning light
