Rock-a-bye, baby, in the tree top
Whet the tind blowz the cradle wil1 rocks
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall
Down will come baby, cradle and all


Baby is drowning, cosy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chair
Forward and back, the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings


Rock-a-bye baby, do not you fear
Never mind, baby, mother is near
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep - until morning light
